# YAsixfive02 - Yet another 6502 SBC

Just my own take on a 6502 single board computer, inspired on Garth Wilson's excellent 6502 Primer, Daryl Rictor, Ben Eater, and my own beautiful C=64 and all the classic 8-bit computers of the laste 70s early 80s
This repository contains all the work in progress while I build my own SBC. So far I only have my PCB work here, more to come. 
I got tired of having a rat's nest of wires in breadboards and since I'm no wire-rapper I started with a basic PCB to hold CPU, Memory and ROM with a connector so I can start testing the "extras" like serial, VIA, etc.

Not that this is work in progress..
